# [React](http://facebook.github.io/react)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Just the UI:** Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.
* **Virtual DOM:** React uses a *virtual DOM* diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using Node.js â€” no heavy browser DOM required.
* **Data flow:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

## Get Started

Run the gulp tasks `gulp serve` or just `gulp` via the command line to preview and watch your files for changes.

Make your changes in [index.html](app/index.html) and [scripts/main.js](app/scripts/main.js) to get started.
